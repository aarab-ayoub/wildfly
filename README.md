# WildFly Installation on Ubuntu

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to install and configure WildFly on an Ubuntu system. WildFly is a flexible and lightweight open-source application server written in Java.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your Ubuntu system:

- Java JDK (OpenJDK recommended)
- curl and wget tools

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt -y install default-jdk curl wget
```

## Step 1: Install Java JDK

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt -y install default-jdk
```

Verify the installed Java version:

```bash
java --version
```

## Step 2: Download WildFly Installation Archive

Install curl and wget:

```bash
sudo apt install curl wget
```

Download and extract WildFly:

```bash
WILDFLY_VERSION=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/wildfly/wildfly/releases/latest|grep tag_name|cut -d '"' -f 4)
wget https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/releases/download/${WILDFLY_VERSION}/wildfly-${WILDFLY_VERSION}.tar.gz
tar xvf wildfly-${WILDFLY_VERSION}.tar.gz
sudo mv wildfly-${WILDFLY_VERSION} /opt/wildfly
```

## Step 3: Configure Systemd for WildFly

Create a system user and group for WildFly:

```bash
sudo groupadd --system wildfly
sudo useradd -s /sbin/nologin --system -d /opt/wildfly  -g wildfly wildfly
```

...

(Continue documenting the remaining steps as per the original instructions)

## Step 5: Accessing WildFly Admin Console

To access the WildFly Admin Console from a web interface, ensure that WildFly is running and reachable on port 9990. Open your web browser and navigate to:

```plaintext
http://your_server_ip:9990
```

Replace `your_server_ip` with the actual IP address of your server.

## Additional Notes

- **Adding WildFly Users:** If you need to add users for administration, use the provided script:

  ```bash
  sudo /opt/wildfly/bin/add-user.sh
  ```

- **Customizing WildFly Configuration:** You can customize WildFly configurations in the `/opt/wildfly/standalone/configuration/` directory.

Feel free to contribute or open issues if you encounter any problems!

```

Make sure to replace placeholders like `your_server_ip` with actual values, and consider providing additional information or troubleshooting tips as needed. Additionally, include any licensing or contribution guidelines relevant to your project.
